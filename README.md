# Burning Ship Navigator
### Description  
The Burning Ship is a fractal generated by measuring the orbits of points on the complex plane under an iterated transformation. This makes it a cousin of the more famous Mandelbrot Set. However, while the Mandelbrot Set is produced by a well behaved "holomorphic" transformation, the Burning Ship is generated with a "non-holomorphic" transformation. This is the cause of the Burning Ship's striking asymmetry. I've been fascinated by this fractal since I first read about it in college and Burning Ship Navigator is one of several tools I've created to explore it. Burning Ship Navigator was written in Python using pygame.
